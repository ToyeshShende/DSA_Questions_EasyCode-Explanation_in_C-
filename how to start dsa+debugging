step 1:
learn concept of dsa 
most recommanded sources :  (paid) GFG self paced course(help you in learning concept and logic building)
                            (free) love babbar dsa placement series( best practice for competitive coding)
                            (free) code with harry dsa series
                            
step 2:

read question clearful all given conditions and testcases ,carefully see Constraints

step 3:

take pen and paper try to write algo or logic on it also analyze the given test case by write on paper check
how they are working then you will get a clear idea and logic and you will complete the code in very short amount of time.

step 4:
for Error debuging:

1)if code passes all given cases but after when you submit it doesn't pass all test cases always check for corner cases like for 0 or 1 or total size

2)if in constrains the maximum limit is give like 10^20(very big numbers) try code with long long data type initialization

3)if code get tle error try to remove nested for loops and obtimize code avoid inizaling so many unneccesary variable ,vectors,set etc.

4)if code get segmentation fault means you might get forgot about return vector or int (write according to function)

5)if code get error for can't recognize vector,set,deque or any built function or stl  you might be forgot to add 
#include <bits/stdc++.h>   as defaultly iostream lib is given.

6)if code get stray//334  or any other stary error check the indentation of return .(should at tab space from where the function initialization started)
